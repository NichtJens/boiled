# boiled
Pythonic OpenAPI clients with minimal boilerplate

## Example

Consider this shortened example generated by openapi-generator-cli:

```python
import openapi_client

configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(host="http://localhost")

with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    api_instance = openapi_client.DefaultApi(api_client)

    some_settings = openapi_client.SomeSettings(mandatory1=1, mandatory2=2)

    try:
        api_instance.something_post(some_settings=some_settings)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

The following small module would be added to the generated client code:

```python
import openapi_client
from boiled import boiled
Client = boiled(openapi_client)
```

This allows the following straight forward interface:
```python
from client import Client

with Client(host="http://localhost") as client:
    try:
        client.something_post(mandatory1=1, mandatory2=2)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```
